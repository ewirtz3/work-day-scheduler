# jQuery Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This application focuses on using jQuery, Local Storage, and Moment.js to create a simple work day scheduler. HTML and CSS are dynamically updated with the time, with time blocks adjusting background color according to if the hour is in the past, present, or future. User inputs calendar items into the text area, and clicking the Save button puts those items into Local Storage. Calendar items persist on the page after refresh.
