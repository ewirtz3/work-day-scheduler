# JQuery Work Day Scheduler Homework

**Objective: Create a dynamic work day scheduler that uses moment.js and local storage to meet the following requirements**

1. Time blocks adjust background color according to if the hour is in the past, present, or future relative to now.
2. User inputs calendar items into the text area, and clicking the Save button puts those items into local storage.
3. Calendar items in local storage will persist on the page, reloading to the appropriate hour blocks upon page reload.
4. Current date is displayed at the top of the page.
